# Pixelfantasia
This is my first ricing, so the config files are VERY messy, same goes with lots of other stuff, also, 

## IMPORTANT REMINDER
Sadly this config files don't work out of the box, you need to install some packages and you need to tweak the configuration files.

## Stuff to install
* Python 3
* i3lock-color
* i3-gaps
* feh
* compton

*Python 3 it's only needed for the scripts in the bar, you can also remove those from the bar if you want*

### Scripts
In the case you want to also use the scripts, you need to install requests using `pip`
